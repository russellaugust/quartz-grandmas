# All Hallow’s Scream
## Presenting the Mystery

*Complexity: 6* 

The Mavens are guests at a Halloween party being thrown at the fabulous Brindlewood Bay home of Abner and Coco Vidal. [[Abner Vidal]], a retired filmmaker famous for gonzo, B-grade pictures greets the Mavens at the front door; he is wearing a King Tut costume.

*Paint the Scene: As you approach the Vidals’ home, what ostentatious thing do you see outside that reminds you the Vidals don’t ﬁt in with Brindlewood Bay’s stuffy upper crust? Also: tell me about your costume.*

After a short scene with Abner, have a few more scenes where we see the Mavens enjoying themselves at the party, which principally takes place at or near the bar. Be sure to introduce all the Suspects in these scenes.

After a few scenes, and after the Suspects have been introduced, the party is interrupted by a shrill scream. Mrs. White has found Abner dead on the covered back porch, his head submerged in a large metal basin being used to bob for apples.

The Mavens can begin investigating right away or they can wait for someone from the sheriﬀ’s department to be called to the scene. No matter what, it’s important that no one be allowed to leave the Vidals’ home until everyone can be questioned. Make it clear to the players that the sheriﬀ ’s department is entirely incompetent and will not be able to crack the case without the Mavens’ help. If you need a character from law enforcement, use Sheriﬀ Dalrymple from Dad Overboard, or [[Deputy Brett Anderson]], a himbo beach cop, in the event Sheriﬀ Dalrymple was implicated in the Dad Overboard murder.

*Establishing Question: You’re having a secret affair with one of the people you’ve talked to at the party tonight. Who is it?*

## Locations
### The bar
This is where the mystery starts—a bar and lounge area just oﬀ the foyer.

*Paint the Scene: The room has been decorated for Halloween using props from Abner’s horror movies. Come up with a name for one of Abner’s schlock masterpieces and then describe the prop from that movie.*

### The Tinseltown room
Dramatic art deco lines. Lots of black lacquer and gold trim. Thick carpets.

*Paint the Scene: As you step inside this sitting room, what do you see that shows it’s a temple to Old Hollywood.*

### The master bedroom
Blood red wallpaper and curtains. Enormous canopy bed. Mirrors overhead.

*Paint the Scene: Abner and Coco had a pretty interesting sex life. What evidence of this do you see casually strewn about the room?*

### Abner’s oﬃce
A framed dollar bill with no particular significance. A top-of-the line computer, still boxed. A talking ‘Cuda the Barracuda mounted to the wall sings “Bad to the Bone” if you press a button.

*Paint the Scene: Abner is very bad at business. Looking around his oﬃce, how do you know this?*

### The screening room
Red velvet movie theater seats. Sconces glowing warmly. The click click click of a film reel.

*Paint the Scene (only if at least one Maven has marked A Shadow in the Garden): The ﬁlm being played, about a hippie commune, is one you don’t recognize. The ﬁlm is in black and white, and there is no audio. It captures the last, violent moments of the commune, with buildings burning and people bloodied and running in terror. What do you see that makes you think the events being depicted are real? The ﬁlm is a Void Clue.*
