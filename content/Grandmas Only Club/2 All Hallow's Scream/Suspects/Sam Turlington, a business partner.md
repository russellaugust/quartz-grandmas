# Sam Turlington, a business partner
Friendly. Boisterous. Phantom of the Opera costume. Sam is a new business partner of Abner’s - they’re investing in some prime retail property near the bay. He likes Abner and is having a swell time at the party.

*Quote: “I’ll tell you this: Abner Vidal isn’t just a ﬁlm visionary. No, no—he’s also got a great mind for business. The plans we’re hatching for the seaside properties are going to make Brindlewood Bay an internationally-renowned vacation spot.”*
