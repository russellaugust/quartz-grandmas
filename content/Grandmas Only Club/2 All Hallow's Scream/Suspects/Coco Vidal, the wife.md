# Coco Vidal, the wife

Air-headed. Sweet. Cleopatra costume. Coco has known Abner since they were teenagers and was frequently an extra in his early films. They’ve been married for nearly forty years.

*Quote: “Why would anyone want to kill Abner? He’s so harmless. It’s true he snores quite a lot, and he’s sometimes a bit of a cheapskate when it comes to dining out, but why would anyone want to kill him over stuff like that?”*
