# Gordon Thune, a banker
Stuﬀy. Put-upon. Frankenstein’s monster costume. Gordon is a local banker and a pillar of the community. He finds Abner personally distasteful, and if not for the filmmaker’s importance as a bank customer, wouldn’t be caught dead at this party.

*Quote: “Who knows what kind of depraved nonsense Abner has planned for us at this party. These Hollywood types… they’re just different from you and me, you know?”*
