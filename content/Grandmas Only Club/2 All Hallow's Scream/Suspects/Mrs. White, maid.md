# Mrs. White, maid
Curmudgeonly. Snoops about. Maid uniform with cat ears. Mrs. White is quiet and always... there. She knows a lot about what happens in the Vidal home. Secretly in love with Coco.

*Quote: “Mr. Vidal was bound to go and get himself killed at some point. You can’t make that many pictures about madness and murder and not have the real thing come knocking on your door at some point. I’m surprised it took this long! The person I’m most worried about is poor Mrs. Vidal. Someone needs to make sure she’s looked after.”*
