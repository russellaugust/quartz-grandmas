BIRDIE sheepishly slides up to the bar, next to her is a model of the heroine from "Mermaids of the OSS" laying across the allied submarine. 

She stares at the bartender, dressed as one of the sailors from the same movie, for a little longer than is necessary, admiring his arms.

BIRDIE 
What's this queen gotta do to get a Cape Codder? I need something to calm me down after that swamp monster run in.

Before the bartender can respond, GORDON THUNE, costumed as Frankensteinâ€™s monster, and SAM TURLINGTON, exuberant in his Phantom of the Opera attire, stride up to the bar. Birdie recognizes Gordon as the local banker, his demeanor usually as stiff as his costume.

GORDON THUNE
Mr. Turlington, may I call you Sam? Sam, Let me buy you a drink. To your venture with Abner. Bartender, two old fashioneds, if you please.

SAM TURLINGTON
(Beaming) Gordon, I'm overwhelmed by the warmth here in Brindlewood Bay. This bash is certainly unlike anything I've ever seen.

GORDON THUNE
Abner does know how to spend his money.

The bartender starts crafting the old fashioneds. Sam's eyes follow each movement.

SAM TURLINGTON
I fear I've been too indulgent tonight. How I'll manage an early start tomorrow to explore the bay is beyond me.

GORDON THUNE
Tonight, we celebrate. Tomorrow's worries can wait.

Birdie makes a meal out of bumping into GORDON, acting fake annoyed at the whole situation.

BIRDIE
Gordon, you almost had me in stitches! What are we celebrating? And I see you've already started without me!

GORDON THUNE, slightly startled by Birdie's sudden approach, regains his composure. He offers a polite, if somewhat forced, smile.

GORDON THUNE
Ah, Birdie, always a pleasure. We're toasting to Sam's new partnership with Abner. They're planning to transform Brindlewood Bay into a vacation paradise.

SAM TURLINGTON lets out a hearty laugh, his Phantom mask slightly askew.

SAM TURLINGTON
You're a lively bunch in this town! Birdie, is it? Pleasure to meet you. I hear you're the local knitting queen.


GORDON THUNE interjects with a more serious tone.

GORDON THUNE
Birdie, you'll have to excuse us. We were discussing business matters. Important for the town's future.


SAM TURLINGTON raises his glass in a mock salute.

SAM TURLINGTON
To new friends and new ventures!

The SAILOR BARTENDER brings out Cape Codder and pushes out over to her. He leans in and speaks quietly to just Birdie.

SAILOR BARTENDER
Between you and me, ma'am, the boss likes us to keep the wealthy crowd happy first. I snuck an extra shot of vodka in your Cape Codder. Hope it makes up for it.
