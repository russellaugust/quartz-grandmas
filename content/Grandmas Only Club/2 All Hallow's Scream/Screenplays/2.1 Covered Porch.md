FADE IN ON:

EXT. COVERED BACK PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

Outside on the porch, the guests are crowded around something off-camera. RUNNING WATER can be heard over their expressions - ranging from shock to disbelief. 

There are gasps and muffled cries as the camera pans across each guest's face before revealing ABNER VIDAL lying DEAD -- his head submerged in a large fountain that has been festively repurposed for apple bobbing. A stream of water splashes against his back.

The water flows from a statue of a nude woman giving a thumbs up. This statue resembles the other in the Vidal's home, clearly part of the same erotica collection.

The MAVENS push their way through the guests into a clearing between the crowd and the body. 

It's time for their expertise once again as everyone turns towards them.
