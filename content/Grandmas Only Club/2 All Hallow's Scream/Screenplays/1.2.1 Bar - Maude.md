Scanning the room like the Terminator, MAUDE focuses in on the route in which the passed hors d'oeuvres have been regularly entering from the kitchen. 

She then proceeds to drag a loud metal chair from the other side of the lounge area directly next to the kitchen door and plops herself into it, awaiting the eventual pigs in blanket bounty which will soon be upon her.

From where she sits, Maude sees a photo "booth" in one corner of the lounge that has a backdrop to make it look like the main villain's home (where she would take her victims) from the movie "Suburban Murder Mommy." The woman dressed in a Sock Hop costume is snapping photo after photo of herself in the booth.

From here, you can hear her talking to another partygoer, speaking a bit too loudly.
