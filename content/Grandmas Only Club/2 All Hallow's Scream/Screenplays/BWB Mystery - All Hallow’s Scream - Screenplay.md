EXT. BRINDLEWOOD BAY - DAY

NARRATOR (V.O.)
Previously on “Brindlewood Bay”...

A series of quick shots show the idyllic seaside views of Brindlewood Bay in summer. Gulls cry, waves lap against boats in the harbor, and quaint shops line the streets.

CUT TO:

INT. CANDLELIGHT BOOKSELLER, 2ND FLOOR - DAY

The MURDER MAVENS, a group of keen senior women, are gathered in a circle, sipping from teacups with a hint of mischief in their eyes.

SHERIFF WYMAN DALRYMPLE (50s) enters, tipping his hat to the ladies.

SHERIFF DALRYMPLE
Ladies, I hate to interrupt, but there’s been a boating accident involving the Krause family.

BERDIE (70s), her eyes wide with recognition.

BERDIE
Oh my... I know Sarah Krause. We had quite an incident on the water once.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE DOCKS - DAY

MAUDE (60s), BERDIE and EDEN (70s) investigate among the ships and sailors. They find shattered pieces of an antique vase.

EDEN
This looks like it could belong to someone with deep pockets...

CUT TO:

INT. SECURITY ROOM AT THE DOCKS - DAY

The ladies sneak into the room and watch security footage. They hear DAVID and SARA discussing changes to a will.

CUT TO:

EXT. KRAUSE FAMILY YACHT - NIGHT

Elegantly dressed guests mingle under jazz tunes at the 4th Annual Warrior’s Ball. The MAVENS blend in with their own charm.

INT. KRAUSE FAMILY YACHT, SARA’S ROOM - NIGHT

The ladies discover more vases and a suspicious clean spot. Berdie uncovers receipts for expensive art purchases.

MAUDE
What if David’s spending was so reckless it got him removed from his father’s will?

CUT TO:

INT. KRAUSE FAMILY YACHT, EMILY’S ROOM - NIGHT

They find EMILY’s computer switched on, someone tried breaking into it.

EDEN
Who desperately needs access to Emily’s computer?

CUT TO:

INT. KRAUSE FAMILY YACHT, MAIN DECK - NIGHT

ALLISON KRAUSE is overheard by the MAVENS as she vents about her deceased husband ALBERT KRAUSE.

ALLISON
(My drunken revelry)
He never appreciated what I did... not even this gala!

The MAVENS exchange concerned glances.

CUT TO:

EXT. BEACH NEAR BODY DISCOVERY SITE - NIGHT

In haunting moonlight, ROBED FIGURES worship at the spot where Albert’s body was found. One figure digs up a piece of the smashed vase and raises it skyward as others follow suit in eerie reverence.

NARRATOR (V.O.)
...and our Murder Mavens drew closer to uncovering a deadly secret amidst the tides of Brindlewood Bay.

FADE OUT.

EXT. VIDAL MANSION - NIGHT

In the quaint New England town of Brindlewood Bay, the Vidal Mansion looms impressively, bathed in the glow of a harvest moon. The mansion, an architectural marvel for such a small town, blends Victorian grandeur with a touch of gothic charm. Ivy clings to its walls, suggesting secrets, though everyone knows Abner Vidal's fortune came from directing tacky but successful gonzo, B-grade pictures.

Autumn leaves rustle underfoot as the MURDER MAVENS, a sprightly group of elderly women with sharp minds and a knack for solving crimes, approach the mansion. They are clad in an array of Halloween costumes and each holding an invitation to Abner and Coco Vidal's Halloween Party.

The approach to the mansion reveals peculiar quirks. A collection of pineapple tchotchkes, oddly prominent, adorns the front porch. Christmas lights, leftovers from the previous holiday season, dangle haphazardly – possibly repurposed as props for, ahem, filming.

Amidst this eclectic décor, a striking statue dominates the scene: a large statue of a fully erect naked man, with the phallus designed as the fountain spout. He gives a jaunty thumbs up to passerby's with a stone rogueish smile.

As the Murder Mavens venture further, they notice a secluded area at the back of the property. It's cordoned off with scrim painted in no-see-um green. This area, somewhat hidden from view, seems to be primarily used for storing filming equipment. 

Maude is dressed as Cher in her iconic 1986 Oscar gown, complete with the large black headdress. Dottie is donning a HAM costume reminiscent of Scout's in "To Kill a Mockingbird", thankfully tailored with practical armholes. Doris, in contrast, wears a Ghostbusters jumpsuit, equipped with a power pack. Birdie is dressed as Freddie Mercury, donning a yellow marching band jacket that she knit herself, a mix of rock-star bravado and homespun charm.

INT. VIDAL MANSION - ENCLOSED PORCH - NIGHT

As the Mavens walk up the steps and approach the front door it SWINGS OPEN suddenly revealing ABNER VIDAL (60s). Abner is dressed as an extravagant King Tut. He stands in the doorway with a wide, theatrical grin.

ABNER
Ah-ha! the illustrious Murder Mavens! Welcome to my humble abode, the ghastly abyss of my twisted imagination! This not just a party; it is an odyssey into the darkest corners of the supernatural. Prepare yourself!

He takes a dramatic bow revealing behind him, the foyer is a carnival of Halloween decorations. A MECHANICAL SWAMP MONSTER swings into the doorway, producing a (not so effective) jump scare. Flickering lights cast eerie shadows.

A legendary coward, Birdie jumps at the swamp monster. Abner turns his attention to DORIS.

ABNER
(nodding proudly)
Doris, my dear, it’s a tragedy I could never convince you to grace my films. You certainly have that je ne sais quoi. 

DORIS
Oh Abner you old charmer, no one wants to see my wrinkly old hoo-haa these days.

She looks around at the monstrous decor, but then back out the window at the perfectly sculpted buttocks of the fountain. Then peers at the swamp monster for a moment

DORIS
Wait - what type of movies do you actually make?  Cause I’m also certainly not going anywhere near that thing.

She points an accusatory finger at the swamp monster. It slowly swings back and forth.

ABNER
While your allure does transcend the ages, our cinematic escapades would have been purely in the realm of the spine-tingling and blood-curdling.
(leans in, lowering his voice with dramatic flair)
And the fountain, ah, a true masterpiece from the shadowy depths of a vintage erotica collection. I came into it some years back.

Turning to Dottie and Birdie...

ABNER
And you two! What a macabre scribe duo you’d make. Ever thought of taking up the mighty pen and drafting a horror script chronicling the Maven’s exploits? I’d produce it in a heartbeat!

DOTTIE grimaces at the horror behind ABNER.

DOTTIE
I’ve always enjoyed a good Agatha Christie novel and suppose I’d take a stab at it myself.  Horror, however... all the chamomile tea in the world couldn’t get me to sleep after a few pages at night.

BIRDIE
Oh, my taste in culture usually skews a little more intentionally sillier than what you all make. It's a bit too much for lil old me. But thank you for having us, hopefully this is less interesting than the last time we were invited over for a holiday party.

Birdie shakes hands with Abner, who appears momentarily embarrassed.

ABNER
Ah yes, ahem... the Christmas light malfunction will live in infamy, it seems. Not quite the winter wonderland I'd envisioned. But tonight, dear Birdie, I promise a spectacle of a different nature. Less seizures and migraines and more and spine-tingling phantasmagoria!

DOTTIE peers again through the doorway.

DOTTIE
I don’t suppose you have any young vampires in there that could help this old ham up these stairs though?

She chuckles lightly at her joke.

ABNER
You laugh, but I see a mistress of the night yonder, at the bar. I doubt she's lifting anyone up a grand staircase, though, as she's likely three sheets to the wind by now.

Abner locks eyes with Maude.

ABNER
(winking)
Maude, you look ravishing as Cher this evening. If only I could turn back time and have a chance to court you!

MAUDE takes in the compliment at complete face-value, smiling while closing her eyes.

MAUDE
Well you must be King Tut, because I feel like I’ve just discovered a treasure that’s been hidden for ages...

She opens her eyes to discover the group has moved ahead, leaving her behind.  Disappointed, she clears her throat, straightens her costume, and catches up with the rest.

INT. FOYER - NIGHT
The Mavens following Abner through the large double doors into his home - MAUDE TRAILING through moments later. 

The foyer is decorated with fake glow-in-the-dark plants. The floor is black and white checkered tiles.  The other side of the Swamp Creature is now visible, mostly wires and cables. It moves back into position to scare the next guest.

DORIS
So where is Ms Coco this evening?  Should I hunt around for a Cleopatra?

As if on cue, COCO VIDAL (60s) floats into view from an open doorway, her Cleopatra costume complementing Abner’s. She speaks with a Valley girl accent and is chewing gum loudly.

COCO
Oh, hey ladies, welcome! The bar is, like, right over there. Abner, darling, don’t go yapping on and boring our lovely guests, okay?

ABNER
(rolling his eyes)
Coco, my dear, you always have impeccable timing.

Hearing of the drunk vampire, DOTTIE shifts her eyes to the bar.  She continues to half listen to the conversation, nodding intently and trying to scan the bar through the door.

MAUDE leans into DORIS'S ear and motions toward Coco.

MAUDE
(whispering)
I do not care for her.

Off Maude's look...

CUT TO:

INT. BAR AND LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

Abner and Coco usher the Mavens through the doorway into a vibrant lounge and bar. The Monster Mash fills the room as costumed guests dance. The lighting casts an enchanting Halloween glow – an improvement from last year.

The walls are a tribute to Abner’s cinematic legacy, showcasing posters of his cult classics: “Return of the Devil Women from Planet X,” “Zombie High School,” “Barracuda II: The ‘Cuda Sleeps at Night,” and “Barracuda VIII: ‘Cuda in Space.”

Navigating through a sea of costumed guests, Abner and Coco lead the Mavens to the bar.

ABNER
(with a charismatic smile)
Enjoy a drink and mingle. I shall be adrift amongst the crowd. Do seek me out for any discourse!

With a flourish, Abner and Coco depart towards Frankenstein who is holding a cocktail, their laughter merging into the festive noise.

The lighting makes it hard to see faces but some costumes stand out: King Tut, Cleopatra, Vampiress, Frankenstein, Maid (with cat ears), Phantom of the Opera, A Man in a Suit and a Sock-hop.

---

INT. BAR AND LOUNGE - LATER

Scanning the room like the Terminator, MAUDE focuses in on the route in which the passed hors d'oeuvres have been regularly entering from the kitchen. 

She then proceeds to drag a loud metal chair from the other side of the lounge area directly next to the kitchen door and plops herself into it, awaiting the eventual pigs in blanket bounty which will soon be upon her.

From where she sits, Maude sees a photo "booth" in one corner of the lounge that has a backdrop to make it look like the main villain's home (where she would take her victims) from the movie "Suburban Murder Mommy." The woman dressed in a Sock Hop costume is snapping photo after photo of herself in the booth.

From here, you can hear her talking to another partygoer, speaking a bit too loudly.


JUNE WILLOUGHBY
Oh, isn't this magnificent? It simply must be the brainchild of dear Abner – only he has the flair for such theatrics. A touch of genius!

She takes a swig of some champagne, makes an overly exaggerated disgusted face, and the dumps it in a nearby glow-in-the-dark plant.

JUNE WILLOUGHBY
But this reeks of Coco's taste, or lack thereof. It’s just like her to buy this cheap swill. Zhampagne! Whoever heard of Zhampagne?
