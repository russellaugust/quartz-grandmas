Doris holding a very colorful drink in a martini glass wanders over to a pedestal on top of which rests a small statue of a nude women whose more sensitive parts are covered in slimy tentacles of something monstrous.  Underneath a plaque reads "Tentacle Monsters from Uranus IV: Slime 'em and Leave 'em"

DORIS
(To Self)
Cinematic escapades my ass, this is porn right?

The maid with the cat ears is in proximity and laughs having overheard Doris

Doris levels the gun from her powerpack at the Maid

DORIS
(To Maid)
And what prey tell are you supposed to be?    

MRS. WHITE
I'm supposed to be -working-, according to Abner. Coco asked me to make the best of it and be festive. This is my festive.

She points to the ears and then leans behind Doris to adjust the slimy tentacle.

MRS. WHITE
I kinda wish Coco would slime Videl and leave 'em. She's too good for him. To have a body and a personality like that! Such a waste on him. Lot of other people who would appreciate her so much more.

Mrs. White has her eyes locked on Coco, who is across the room with Abner and laughing with Frankenstein.

DORIS
What's their story anyways? An eccentric with a theatrical mind, a California beauty - it's almost like a movie itself.

MRS. WHITE
(Sighing)
Maybe a tragic comedy. Abner is a hack, he just stumbled into his success. Timing and luck, that's all. Coco was his muse, you know. They met when they were still teenagers. In his early films, she was always there in the crowd, a bright spot in the trashy chaos. Coco's still got that sparkle, but Abner... he's been living in his own world for too long. And Coco, well, she just got swept along for the ride.

Coco, still across the room, throws her head back in laughter, her Cleopatra costume glittering under the lights. Abner kisses her hand and walks out of the lounge, waving theatrically. Mrs. White glares at Abner as he disappears.

MRS. WHITE
But between you and me, I think Coco deserves better. She's got a heart of gold, and Abner... well, let's just say he's not the man he used to be.

Mrs. White shakes her head.

MRS. WHITE
Well, I need to get back to tidying up an active party.

She walks off.
