INT. BAR AND LOUNGE - MOMENTS LATER

Abner and Coco usher the Mavens through the doorway into a vibrant lounge and bar. The Monster Mash fills the room as costumed guests dance. The lighting casts an enchanting Halloween glow – an improvement from last year.

The walls are a tribute to Abner’s cinematic legacy, showcasing posters of his cult classics: “Return of the Devil Women from Planet X,” “Zombie High School,” “Barracuda II: The ‘Cuda Sleeps at Night,” and “Barracuda VIII: ‘Cuda in Space.”

Navigating through a sea of costumed guests, Abner and Coco lead the Mavens to the bar.

ABNER
(with a charismatic smile)
Enjoy a drink and mingle. I shall be adrift amongst the crowd. Do seek me out for any discourse!

With a flourish, Abner and Coco depart towards Frankenstein who is holding a cocktail, their laughter merging into the festive noise.

The lighting makes it hard to see faces but some costumes stand out: King Tut, Cleopatra, Vampiress, Frankenstein, Maid (with cat ears), Phantom of the Opera, A Man in a Suit and a Sock-hop.
