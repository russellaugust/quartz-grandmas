DOTTIE attempts to casually saunter towards the bar.  Her HAM costume proves to be rather ungainly as she bumps into a guest, spilling a bit of their drink.

Reaching the bar, DOTTIE flags down the BARTENDER.  She wiggles her fingers as she scans the bar.

DOTTIE
(To BARTENDER)
I don't suppose you have any fresh squeezed orange juice behind there, do you?  I'd love a screwdriver if you can make one.

The himbo bartender with a clueless grin nods eagerly.

BARTENDER
(a charming but vacant smile)
Oh, totally! Let's get you juiced up with some of that good ol' vitamin C!

He bounces off to work on the drink, his muscular arms flexing as he handles the fruit. The costume's bulk makes it difficult for Dottie to watch him, but the clinking and shaking sounds promise something is being made.

Unable to turn her head in the HAM costume, she turns her entire body towards the VAMIPRESS at the bar

DOTTIE
(To VAMPIRESS)
I know it's a bit of an unusual choice, but it was Truman Capote's favorite drink, after all. Furthermore, the vitamin C can help with the hangover the next morning.  At least that's what I keep telling myself.

ELENA VISAGE
(slurring her words)
I met Capote once. I tried to get the lead role in Breakfast at Tiffany's. They told me I was too young! Can you believe that? Too young. Now all I seem to be good for is matronly roles. Me! Did you know that Variety once said my performance in Devil Women from Planet X was the most acting they’d ever seen?

Elena finally makes eye contact with Dottie and seems to be hit with a wave of recognition.

ELENA VISAGE
Dottie MacGuire, of the local Murder Mavens book club? Ah-ha! So nice to meet you. I'm Elena Visage. I suspect you're more of a Murder by Death Capote fan, then. Abner talks about you all the time.

DOTTIE awkwardly tries to nod, ends up somewhat bowing at the hip in her costume.

DOTTIE
Dottie MacGuire, in the hog flesh! Pleasure, dear. And you must be one of the actresses of our lovely host? And you’ve hit the nail on the head, Murder by Death is one of my favorites. Make no mistake, I love Breakfast at Tiffany’s as well, it’s nice to have some lighthearted romanticism from time to time. There’s nothing wrong with a little escapism from time why look around, isn’t that what most of this is?

DOTTIE gestures about the room at the collection of decorations. Her eyes catch a poster behind the himbo bartender: "BC Buxom Barbarians." Lining the bar behind the bottles are several promo cardboard cutouts of human women and anthropomorphic dinosaurs in cheetah print bikinis holding clubs. DOTTIE loses herself in thought wondering why in the world a cold-blooded dinosaur would have breasts before returning to the conversation. 

DOTTIE 
Anyways, I could get lost in a novel for hours. Anything from a classic to one of those trashy teen vampire novels.

ELENA VISAGE
Ain't that the truth, dear. I've spent my life being a conduit for other people's escape. 

After stashing his tools away — a squeezed orange, a boxcutter, scissors, and Sharpie marker — the bartender turns back around and slides the drink towards Dottie with an enthusiastic thumbs-up.

It's a glass brimming with freshly squeezed orange juice, but sticking out of it is a crudely cut plastic screwdriver, its handle adorned with childlike Sharpie details.

BARTENDER
(beaming, proud of his creation)
Here ya go! One juicy screwdriver. Pretty cool to hear it's a gangster's favorite drink.

He turns back around to clean the pieces of hard plastic all over the table.

Elena glances down at the drink.

ELENA VISAGE
Good thing you didn't ask for a dry martini. He would've spent an hour blowdrying it. 

Elena watches the muscles in his arm move. 

ELENA VISAGE
And don't bother asking for a "Sex on the Beach", I tried that already.

Dottie and Elena both turn toward a man shouting into his phone. He is costumed as a... business manager?

MARCUS GREAVES
(into phone)
Yes it's Halloween -- no, it isn't a joke! 'Cuda Girl: Barracuda in Love' numbers are a disaster! It'll never recoup it's budget -- Uh huh, I know -- Well, then figure out how to soften the -- That isn't my job to --

ELENA VISAGE
Speaking of escapism, Marcus Greaves could do with a bit of that. Twenty years, and what? He's still hanging onto just a handful of clients like Abner. Not that I'm complaining, mind you. Abner's flicks, they bring in the dough. Lord knows, I've been soaking up that gravy train for more years than I care to admit.
