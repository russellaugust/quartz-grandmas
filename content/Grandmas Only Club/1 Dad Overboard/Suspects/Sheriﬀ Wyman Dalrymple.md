# Sheriff Wyman Dalrymple, an oﬃcial
Jowly, paunchy, speaks with a permanently exasperated tone. Without anything to go on, he’ll have to let the Krauses raise anchor and leave. He’s reluctant to ask the Murder Mavens for their help, but he knows they have had some success solving cases in the past.
