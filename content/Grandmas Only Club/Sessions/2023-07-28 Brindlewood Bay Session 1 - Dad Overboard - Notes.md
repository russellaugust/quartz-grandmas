# Session Notes
  
It’s the summer of 2023 and The Murder Mavens are having their Book Club meeting on the 2nd floor of the Candlelight Bookseller.  
  
It's a cozy and nice looking bookstore, reminiscent of an older era and a slower place of life. The Mavens are drinking spiked tea with whisky.  
  
As usual, the ladies are reading one of the books in the Golden Crown mysteries by Amanda Delacourt.

[[Sheriﬀ Wyman Dalrymple]] enters and tells the ladies about a boating accident. The Krause Family yacht is a ¼ mile from shore. Allison Krause (the wife), Emily (daughter), David (son), Sarah (eldest daughter) - the father Albert Krause fell over and washed up on shore - body at cold storage at Brindlewood Bay fish market.  

Berdie realizes she knows Sarah Krause - because Birdie hit their boat once with her boat and it was a huge deal.

The family came down to brindlewood bay on their yacht - they were living on the yacht for vacation. They take the dingy out to yachts

The Murder Mavens need to find evidence of foul play.

Jamie and Doris decide to head to the fish market for clues. They also heard that tuna was going to be 20% off at the fish market today!

At fish market: Tommy the fish monger - who pretends to be French to seem more authentic - has the body (he's really from Ohio). The Murder Mavens harassed poor Tommy, shouting his name over and over at him until he let them see the body.

While looking at the body, they asked Tommy about the Krause family. He seemed to know about them because they are a wealthy family that vacations in Brindlewood Bay during the summer because they like the authentic new england feel. 

Albert Krause seemed to have a normal family life, at first glance. 

Sara Krause has 3 kids, boston.
David Krause is a douche bag, crazy fashion “artsy”  
Emily Krause is a big NERD - loves computers
Allison Krause is “Fine” she appears normal.

A clue was discovered on Albert Krauses's dead body - A watch - it's working but it's the wrong time, seems to be 3 hours behind. It's a nice watch.

While leaving the fish market, the Murder Mavens decide to buy 3 lbs of discount TUNA.

Maude, Berdie and Eden are going to THE DOCKS to investigate. Bird's husband was friendly with the dock workers.

While investigating the local docks, the Murder Mavens learned that the Krause Family showed up next day, we do not know if they were on the boat. They also discover that the Krause family is here to throw a gala out on the water. No one knows what the event is for because the low class members of Brindlewood Bay aren't invited. Especially not the people in the fish market or the dock workers.

Jackie and Jake are dock workers.

A clue was discovered on the docks, it was the smashed pieces of an antique vase. It looked fancy, and EXPENSIVE.
  
The Murder Mavens learned that the Krause kids all live out of town, but they vacation here in Brindlewood Bay.

The Murder Mavens realize that there are security cameras at dock, and the security guy at the docks, named Matt, watches them. They break into the security room while Matt is away and watch the security camera tape. On the tape, they see David and Sara discussing someone removed from will. Shockingly, these security cameras have sound!

The Murder Mavens decide to use Birdie’s boat to head off the Krause's yacht gala. It got real fancy its a jazz gala. The Murder Mavens might be getting a little drunk.
  
The Murder Mavens discover that the gala is the 4th Annual Warrior’s Ball - A testicular cancer fundraiser hosted by Allison Krause. They split up to mingle and meddle around the ship. 

They overhear Allison drunkenly complaining about her dead husband, how he was never appreciative of her efforts, like this gala, and even in death is trying to stop her from throwing the gala. She definitely not mad Albert is dead.

Andrew, the butler, is suspicious of Jamie.

The Murder Mavens break into Sara’s room and found the missing vase, because they found other vases and a clean spot where those no dust where a vase should be placed between the other vases.  Inside the vases are receipts from a west cost stores, and there are lots of money spent there, mostly art and art related things.

The Murder Mavens began to think that maybe DAVID is abusing the money for his art stuff. Maybe he was cut from will and so he's spending a lot now.

The Murder Mavens began to think that Albert Krause went to the west coast to investigate the receipts because of all the spending.

They also discovered that someone was trying to get into Emily’s computer. Because when they came in, it was already on.

They learn that Allison was cut out the will. And Emily has the will on her computer on the boat that someone was trying to access.

The Murder Mavens have now discovered their fourth clue and are able to do the Theorize Move.

The Murder Mavens correctly theorized that the Allison Krause killed her husband because he was spending money on everyone but her, she killed him with a vase we think. 

In a final image, near where the body of Albert Krause washed up, robed figures with their faces shadowed and distorted by moonlight, are worshiping the exact spot where the body was. Is it the location of the body they are worshipping? We think so, until one robed figure reaches into the sand, pushing the sand away and revealing one of the pieces of the smashed vase. The robed figure lifts the vase piece up to the sky as the rest of the figures raise their arms toward it, silhouetted by the moon.

# Episode Summary
During a summer meeting at Candlelight Bookseller, the Murder Mavens book club is interrupted by [[Sheriﬀ Wyman Dalrymple]], who reports a tragic boating incident involving the Krause family. Albert Krause, the father, has been found dead, his body washing up near Brindlewood Bay and stored at the local fish market's cold storage.

Berdie, a member of the book club, recalls a past run-in with Sarah Krause after accidentally colliding with the family's boat on a previous occasion. It's revealed that the Krauses are vacationing on their yacht and have come to town for a secretive gala.

Maude, Berdie, and Eden set off to investigate at the docks where they learn about the exclusivity of the upcoming event, which has left local townies uninvited. While scouring the area for clues, they find shattered remnants of an expensive antique vase.

Evidence pointing to possible foul play continues to mount as they discover security footage from dock cameras showing David and Sarah Krause discussing changes in their father's will. The cameras, surprisingly equipped with audio capture their conversation about someone being removed from the will.

Determined to dig deeper, the Murder Mavens attend the Krause yacht's gala undercover. The event is revealed to be the 4th Annual Warrior’s Ball, a fundraiser for testicular cancer organized by Allison Krause. During their snooping around, Allison is overheard bitterly remarking on her late husband's lack of appreciation for her efforts such as organizing the gala; her tone suggests she isn't grieving his loss.

Suspicion further arises when Andrew, the butler, seems wary of Jamie. In Sara’s room onboard, they find evidence that suggests David might be misappropriating funds for his art endeavors – supported by receipts for extravagant spending out West. The Mavens speculate that Albert Krause had gone to investigate these suspicious expenditures.

A break-in attempt on Emily’s computer leads them to another significant discovery: Allison was cut from Albert's will—a will that exists on Emily's computer. With enough clues gathered, they deduce that Allison murdered her husband out of resentment for his financial neglect toward her; they suspect she used a vase as her murder weapon.

In a chilling coda, shadow-cloaked acolytes gathered at the desolate strand where Albert's corpse had washed ashore, unearthing a shard of the fractured vase. Bathed in the baleful glow of an uncanny moon, the robed figures chanted in low, discordant tones, their voices weaving a tapestry of dread through the thick, miasmic air.
