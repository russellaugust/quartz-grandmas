Never married to anybody worth a damn, dead to me. 1 kid that i don’t speak to, probably a couple grandkids, all dead to me. 1 sister, dead to me. Dogs are family but don’t own any myself, can’t take care of them, so I volunteer at the pound.  I love dressing up in costumes  Was a Detective in P-town but thrown off the force for non-sanctioned approaches and i don’t want to talk about it.

Cozy Place: Dog towels and linens, Large elaborate feather boas, Pictures with cut out heads, burn marks, sharpies, Stray cat (I’m not 100% it’s a cat, think it’s a raccoon, and it’s not mine, but i leave food out)
