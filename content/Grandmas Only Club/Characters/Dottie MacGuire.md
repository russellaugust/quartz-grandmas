**Backstory:** Debora "Dottie" MacGuire grew up in Boston.  She spent most of her adult life working as a children's librarian at Samuel Adams Elementary School.  While there, she fell in love with Lois Harrigan, the English teacher.  They lived together as "friends" in an apartment in Boston for many years, walking to school together daily.  Although they had no children, Dottie loved working with the students and was well-liked at the school.  

They had a happy life together for many years until Lois mysteriously drowned in Boston Harbor at 53 years old while out for a walk alone while Dottie was working late in the children's' library.  Suspecting foul play, Dottie dedicated nearly two decades of her life investigating the death.  Fearing the mystery was consuming her, Dottie eventually packed up and moved to a small cottage in Brindlewood Bay.  

Since then, she has volunteered at the local library, splitting her time between working there and knitting for cats and families in need in town.  Growing up with an affinity for the strays of Boston, she immediatley became known as the "cat lady," leaving out bowls of food for the strays around Brindlewood Bay.  Although she has many cats, the only one allowed inside is Sprinkles, a 12 year old orange tabby she brought with her from Boston.
