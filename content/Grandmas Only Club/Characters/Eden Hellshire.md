## Eden Hellshire
Player: Dane
Age: 78-years-old
Backstory: I am single, but rarely alone. Never married, though I have a 50-year-old son who owns a fancy restaurant I’ve never been invited to. I am a proud lottery winner, retired since that fateful day 23 years ago. And I bet you can guess where my piece-of-shit son got the money for that restaurant… But he did give me a grand-daughter, Beverly, who visits me now and again on her college breaks.
Style: Think of me as a total 'Samantha'.
